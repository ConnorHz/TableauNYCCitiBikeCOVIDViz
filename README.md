# NYC Citi Bike Trip Analysis: June 2019/2020
Citi Bike is the largest bike sharing program in the United States, serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhatten, and Queens. With a daily ridership of around 56,500 in 2019, I was curious what effect, if any, the COVID-19 pandemic would have on the usage of the bikes. Using the publicly available [Citi Bike System Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) as well as Tableau, I created some visualizations to help make some observations on possible effects.

You can take a look at the visualizations [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/connor.hertz#!/vizhome/NYCOVIDCitiBikeTripAnalysis/June2019vs2020)

## Observation 1: There are less trips in June 2020 than in June 2019

This one was expected. A large number of daily trips, I believe, can be attributed to people commuting to and from work. With the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people were working from home, thus, no need to bike to work. The difference bewteen trips isn't that much (~200,000), but it is pretty telling to see a signifigant reduction in trips from 7-9AM.

## Observation 2: There are significantly more round trips in June 2020 than in June 2019

I could also see this being attributed to the pandemic. Rather than biking to meet up with friends for a drink, or biking to work, I would assume most trips taken in 2020 would be to run some kind of errand and immidieatly return home. In looking at trips that start and end at the same station, June 2020 has roughly 50% more than June 2019.

## Observation 3: Weekend trips saw no real change in terms of frequency

This is one that I found surprising. I would have expected a lower number of weekend trips as more people were staying home, but I found that there was no real change. People we still out on the bikes at the same rate during the same times.
